#+TITLE: Guidance for developing Knowledge Base for Indian Academic Environment

* Introduction
Our main goal is to come up with a Knowledge Base (KB) that is specifically for Indian Academic
environment. This should capture the academic concepts related to NPTEL video
courses, Virtual Lab experiments, GATE syllabus and Academic degree syllabus
that Universities and their Affiliates use.

Our scope is not to make an exhaustive KB but to make a representative
prototype. 

We will use indicative and representative samples of course, university, lab,
video material to showcase the value of having such a KB. 

** Knowledge Base (KB)- our notion
This is how we define a Knowledge Base (KB). It is a conceptual representation
of a domain PLUS it is a set of assertions of instances of information that is 
given in the conceptual representation.

** Indian Academic Environment
Indian academic environment is of significance because of its scale and
uniqueness. Also, this unique environment is under represented in knowledge
bases. 

For our usage,  we are considering currently only including the academic
material related to NPTEL, Virtual Labs (both MSHRD initiatives), and also
GATE-syllabus. Also, in India, we have the notion of a single University
catering to multiple Affiliate colleges. So, some University structures that
reflect this would also need to be included in our model.

*** GATE-syllabus
GATE is a pan India competitive exam used for higher studies in universities. It is
similar to GRE and GMAT. Indian GATE exam is highly competitive in that
millions of students are impacted by it. Every year over 800,000 students
participate in it. GATE exams have been in place for past couple of decades. As a
result, there is a history, consistency, system and discipline to these GATE
exams. Also, as the topics represented in GATE are universal to all Science and
Engineering students (across the world), the web is full of such related
content. However, that content may be scattered and not be tuned and aligned to the GATE
preparatory orientation that we are seeking in our conceptual model. Our work
is to create an umbrella relationship between such disjoint material and
constrain it in exam-preparatory or pedagogical framework.

** Motivation 
Indian academic environment is large in scale. Every year millions of students
participate in University courses, take competitive exams and search on topics
related to course syllabus. 

GATE exam alone has hundreds of thousands of participants. Its history, format
and preparatory material is quite well defined. 

We feel that to provide intelligence to Web Applications we need to have a
proper knowledge base that is well representative of this unique academic
environment in India.

Fig 2: Intelligence of Web Applications can come from having a back-end KB.

*** Sample web applications that need KB
A GATE preparatory web app can depend on KB to recommend new learning material,
suggest new links, correlate question to an answer etc.

A NPTEL page or a Virtual Lab page may be renarrated with new alternate views
containing information that is obtained by processing queries to our KB.

A student learning or teacher instructing related web apps can also be
developed that navigate the KB to offer complex suggestions and give new
insight to students and instructors alike.

** Scope 
We aim to develop only a representative conceptual model. For our purposes we
will use the GATE exam specifics for year 2017, as published by Indian
Govt. For University, NPTEL, Virtual Lab information, we will only rely on
publicly available information (searched during May, 2017 timeframe). 

* Approach
There are indeed many types of Semantic representations that are possible for
developing our KB. However, due to the popularity and ubiquity of Ontologies, we are
herewith restricting our work to such a representation only. That is, the
conceptual representation of our domain will be implemented with Ontologies.

In implementing Ontologies, we will utilize Protege, a tool developed by
Stanford and promoted by University of Manchester.

* working with Ontologies
As indicated by Figure #3, there are quite a few pre-existing Ontologies that
we can utilize in our development of our KB.

** Interdependency with existing Ontologies 
We scanned the existing Ontology databases for GATE, University, Exam etc. We
also scanned them for related key words (derived from synonyms). We found FOAF
for people representation. We found X for Bloom. For exams we found. We used
the represent our 

GATE Syllabus is the central part of the ontology
The other parts include
- Q&A or exam taxonomy (for structuring GATE)
- Bloom's Taxonomy (for a topic)
- FOAF (for students and faculty)

** Some challenges with knowledge representation:
- do we represent knowledge (A-BOXes) in a single OWL file?
- Or, do we have additional files for assertions? 
- And, assuming the presence of additional files
  - how do we link the A-BOX with T-BOX
  - when do we associate the two? statically (that is have a static knowledge
    base). Or, dynamically, that is, users can keep adding and deleting from
    these relationships 

** KB Development plan
in v1.0 we have a integrated KB
in v2.0 we have a seperate file for assertions which is statically configured
in v3.0 we have a dynamically configured, external assertion A-BOX file that is controlled by user


* Methodology
The development of our proposed KB can be divided into the following parts.
++ Development of the Conceptual Representation (Ontology) for our domain
++ Development of the predicates / assertions that instantiate our Ontology
++ Guidance for quering and analyzing our KB
++ A user interface for interacting with our KB

** Development of the Ontology for our KB
There are many methods for developing an Ontology. However, we are following
the tutorial published by University of Manchester. 

[[academic.owl][Here]] is a sample of the ontology that we are currently experimenting with. It
has its limitations. We see that a new more finer decomposition is
needed. However, for historic records we are including [[academic.owl][this]] preliminary
version.

Going forward we foresee the need to have multiple, separate Ontologies that
co-exist and that are also linked through our own upper level, integrating
ontology. This has been shown in Figure #3.

Development of such a conceptual model would require a methodology which is
given below...

*** Verification questions
According to the topdown strategy, we need to have some Verification Questions
that link our development efforts to the overall purpose of the Ontology. Here
are the verification questions:

*** People oriented Verification Questions
Student related to this Ontology include:
- name?
- affiliated instituition
- 

*** Faculty oriented verification questions
