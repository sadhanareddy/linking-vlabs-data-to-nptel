#+Title: Renarration demo for NPTEL

* NPTEL renarrations ( Objectives )
+ Change Layout.
+ Change Language.
+ Show more info for each course.
For this objectives we need a KB that has information on NPTEL,
VLABS, GATE. We also need a mechanism to query the KB. Finally
we need a mechanism to clasify the Knowledge in the current page
for querying.

* Knowledge Base
We are planning to use ontology for representing domain knowledge of NPTEL, VLABS
and may be even GATE.

We may populate the individual data for the ontological concepts either 
dynamically ( i.e., only when visitig NPTEL or VLABS website ) or statically
once before hand. For first implementation we are going with  limited 
static approach.

Our knowledge base may be an owl file stored on some cloud database
that is queriable from server/client.
 
** Implemnetation details
+ T-box transactions for courses, faculty, university... need to be defined.

+ A-box assertions for above T-box transactions need to be populated.

+ A owl file containing a T,A box ( knowledge Base ) should be created.

* Interacting with KB 
+ Given some meta info extracted from either or NPTEL or VLABS site we
should be able to query KB ( may be by using SPARQL ) to get other 
related info.

+ Develop SPARQL query mechanism to get additional info from KB based on
meta info obtained from NPTEL, VLABS site.

** Types of NPTEL queries 
+ Other course taught by this professor.
+ Other courses that are similar to this course.
+ Prerequisites for this course.
+ References for this course.
+ Labs for this course.
+ Gate questions for this course.

* Extracting meta info from sites
+ Be able to extract and populate NPTEL structure from NPTEL site.

+ Be able to extract and populate vlabs structure from Vlabs site

+ Based on info in the data structure query knowledge base for additional info.

+ Analyse and show new info in new way. ( This is renarration )

** Data structure for NPTEL
+ Come up with the Data structure ( JSON ?) for NPTEL site.
+ This should include lot of video related meta data like 
   - course name
   - faculty name
   - video data
   - prerequisites

** Data structure for VLABS
+ Come up with data structure ( JSON?) for vlabs. 
+ This should include
  - Subject 
  - no of exps...

** Data structure for GATE
This is yet to be implemented.
+ Come up with data structure ( JSON?) for GATE. 
+ This should include
  - Subject
  - Questions,
  - Ans...
Look at online syllabus for more info.
